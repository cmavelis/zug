      <p>
        "zug" is the name of the game. I got it from the first syllable of
        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang">"zugzwang"</a>, a
        German term I learned from chess, meaning "compulsion to move". A
        fundamental part of the design is that each player is required to use
        all of their pieces each turn. I also thought the name was fitting
        because the moves in this game are similar to chess pawns.

        I first decided to make this game as a stepping-stone to a bigger and
        more complicated game that's been brewing in my head for over 10 years.
        Now, I feel like it's interesting enough that I'm committed to making it
        good in its own right. I hope you like it!
